<h1>Welcome to the greatest web page that ever was or ever will be</h1>
<h2>...Just like the city of Quarth</h2>
<h3>From the following link: <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Qarth">http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Qarth</a></h3>
<img src="quarth.jpg">
<p>"We call Qarth "the Greatest City that Ever Was or Will Be". An easy claim to make if one knows only the docks and custom houses of other cities. An easy lie to swallow if a people only see the gold and jewels of their rulers, which we, the Thirteen who govern this city, are careful to ensure."</p>
<p>         -- Xaro Xhoan Daxos</p>
<p>Quarth is ruled by The Thirteen. The known member are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Spice King</li>
  <li>The Copper King</li>
  <li>The Silk King</li>
  <li>Xaro Xhoan Daxos</li>
  <li>Pyat Pree</li>

<h1>Welcome to the second half of the Game of Thrones themed web page</h1>
<h2>Where we are the watchers on the wall</h2>
<h3>From the following link: <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night's_Watch">http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night's_Watch</a></h3>

<p>The Night's Watch oath goes:</p>
<p>"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."</p>
<p>The three orders and some important people in those orders are:</p>
