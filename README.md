# Simple-HTTP-Server
A simple HTTP server written in C

This program is a simple HTTP server that responds to GET requests. The program uses a TCP library not written by myself -- I built on top of the code to include the HTTP server. The server will handle HTTP codes: 200, 404, 405, 415.

Server is compatible with browsers. I have incuded an example HTML website that the user can request and load in a browser. 

The server is fully tested and functional.

I completed this project for a Networking course I took in the Spring semester of 2016 at the University of Kentucky -- I received an A.
